# Project: A Smart Car Accident Alert System for Real-Time Help 

### Problem:
Road accidents are a leading cause of injury and death globally. Even with advancements in car safety features, a critical factor in improving outcomes is the time it takes for emergency responders to reach the scene. Delays can lead to serious complications and loss of life.

### Challenge:
Currently, there's no universally adopted system for automatic accident notification with real-time location data. This often relies on bystanders or injured occupants to call for help, which can be time-consuming or impossible in critical situations.

### Proposed Solution:
This project proposes a car accident alert system that can automatically detect a collision and transmit an SMS notification with the car's location to pre-designated emergency contacts.

### Benefits:
- **Faster Emergency Response:** Automatic notification can significantly reduce the time it takes for help to arrive, potentially saving lives and reducing injuries.
- **Improved Coordination:** Emergency responders can receive vital information about the accident location before reaching the scene, allowing for better response planning.
- **Peace of Mind:** The system can provide a sense of security for drivers and passengers, knowing that help will be on the way in case of an accident.

### Components Required:
#### Hardware:
- Arduino Uno(nano)
- Accelerometer 
- Wifi module(ESP8266)
- LCD screen 
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- DC power supply
- Ultrasonic motion sensor
-  GPS module

#### Software:
- Tinkercad simulation platform
- Kicad or EasyEda for PCB design
- Twilio account (for SMS notification)
- Google Maps API

### Project Functionality:
- The accelerometer continuously measures acceleration (g-forces) along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- Pre-defined thresholds are set for each axis to represent a potential collision based on estimated g-forces during an impact.
- A threshold distance (e.g., 30 cm) is set for the ultrasonic sensor to indicate an imminent collision.
- If either the accelerometer readings exceed their thresholds (sudden acceleration) or the ultrasonic sensor detects a distance less than the threshold (close proximity), a potential collision is detected.
- Upon collision detection:
  - (An LCD displays a message like "Collision Detected!" and the measured distance.
  - A buzzer sounds as an alarm.
  - The ESP8266 module connects to a Wi-Fi network.
  - An SMS notification is sent via Twilio, including:
    - A message like "Car Accident! Help Needed!"
    - A Google Maps link to the accident location (using latitude and longitude data retrieved from a GPS module or smartphone; not simulated in Tinkercad).
- The system is configured to transmit data continuously to a cloud platform like Thingspeak for data logging and visualization.
